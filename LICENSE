                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                   0. This License Agreement applies to any
  software library or other program which contains a notice placed
  by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
  terms of this Lesser General Public License. The "Library", below,
  refers to any such software library or program, and a "work based
  on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work
  under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library
  or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.

                   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any
  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
  on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
  warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
  and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
  License along with the Library.

                   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the
  Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
  Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
  the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
  these conditions:

                     a) The modified work must itself be a software
  library.

                     b) You must cause the modified files to carry
  prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date
  of any change.

                     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be
  licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
  License.

                     d) If a facility in the modified Library
  refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an
  application program that uses the facility, other than as an
  argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
  a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
  does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
  and performs its intended task. (For example, if the Library
  allows access to a table of logarithms, and the application does
  not supply it, then the Library must provide a default table, or
  at least have a way of computing logarithms.)

                   3. You may link the Library with other works
  to produce a work based on the Library. You may copy and
  distribute the resulting work under the terms of your choice,
  provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                     a) The work must itself be a software library.

                     b) The modified work must itself be a software
  library.

                     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be
  licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
  License.

                     d) You must cause the modified files to carry
  prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date
  of any change.

                   4. You may distribute the Library in object code
  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
  do one of the following:

                     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.

                     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for
  at least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code
  either (1) a copy of the complete corresponding machine-readable
  source code, or (2) access to the source code for a reasonable
  fee; this offer must be valid for at least three years and must
  comply with the requirements of the previous paragraph.

                   5. You may not impose any further restrictions
  on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
  License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,
  or other charge for this License or for exercise of the rights
  granted hereunder.

                   6. This License is not intended to limit the
  rights of the recipients of the Library's code under the terms of
  the General Public License.

                   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish
  revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License
  from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
  the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
  problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing
  version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
  License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
  or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

                   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library
  into other free programs whose distribution terms are different, write
  to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
  by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
 we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
  two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                   9. There is no warranty for the Library. Except
  when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other
  parties provide the Library "as is" without warranty of any kind,
  either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
  implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
  purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  Library is with you. Should the Library prove defective, you assume
  the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

                  10. In no event unless required by applicable law
  or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other
  party who modifies and/or conveys the Library, be liable to you for
  damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
  damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Library (including
  but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or
  losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Library to
  operate with any other software), even if such holder or other party
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                  11. This License shall be governed by the laws of
  the State of Massachusetts, USA. If you cannot comply with this License,
  you must remove the Library from your distribution or otherwise cease
  using it.

                  12. If any portion of this License is held to be
  invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner
  consistent with applicable law to affect the intent of the parties, and
  the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.

                  13. This License is in effect for all copies or
  substantial portions of the Library. If you do not accept this License,
  you may not use, modify, or distribute the Library.
